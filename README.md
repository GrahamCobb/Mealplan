# Mealplan

This is a purely personal project unlikely to be of interest to anyone else.  
However, I have uploaded it just in case any of the code is useful to anyone.

This is a small app I use for planning meals for the week to help with shopping.

It is a QML javascript app.  It currently works fine on my personal Linux system
and I am working on getting it to work on an iPad.
